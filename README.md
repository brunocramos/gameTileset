Game Tileset System/Boilerplate
===========

A simple Game Tileset system/boilerplate using HTML5/Canvas, with viewport enabled.
This was based on HTML5 Gamer's article[1] located below, but with some architecture improvements.

Feel free to fork and apply as many changes as you desire!



**To do:**
- Make a FPS counter
- Create a character to move through viewport
- Prevent character from walking through some tiles (blocks on the JSON file)
- Much more
